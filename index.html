      <strong>T</strong>im <strong>B</strong>erners-<strong>L</strong>ee invented the <strong><em>World Wide Web</em></strong> in 1989. He founded and Directs the World Wide Consortium (<strong>W3C</strong>) the forum for technical development of the <span lang="us">Web</span>. He founded the <span lang="us">Web</span> Foundation whose mission is that the WWW serves Humanity, and co-founded the Open Data Institute in London. His research group at MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab ("CSAIL") plans to re-decentralize the <span lang="us">Web</span>. Tim spends a lot of time fighting for rights such as privacy, freedom and openness of the <span lang="us">Web</span>.
A graduate of Oxford University, <strong>T</strong>im <strong>B</strong>erners-<strong>L</strong>ee invented the <span lang="us">Web</span> while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first <span lang="us">Web</span> client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and <strong>HTML</strong> were refined as <span lang="us">Web</span> technology spread.
</p>
<p>
He is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence ( CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he also heads the Decentralized Information Group (DIG). He is also a Professor in the Electronics and Computer Science Department at the University of Southampton, UK.
</p>
<p>
Tim is the Director of the <strong><em>World Wide Web</em></strong> Consortium (<strong>W3C</strong>), a <span lang="us">Web</span> standards organization founded in 1994 which develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the <span lang="us">Web</span> to its full potential.
